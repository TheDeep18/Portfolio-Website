            <h1>Understanding the Users</h1>
            <p>In this project, we took the goal oriented approach and found modulated research method to be the best
                fit for this project.
                Started out by writing few question regarding the project.
            </p>
            <div class="questions">
                <li>"What is the product?"</li>

        <div id="userResearchSummary">
            <h1>User research summary</h1>
            <p>The Experience of UX research was fantastic. We conducted a modulated research survey for the bakery app.
            </p>
            <p>The assumptions were the user will easily find the login page, but at the time of research we found that
                there were few bugs in the prototype.</p>
            <p>I assumes that the Cash on Delivery payment only will work, but during the study we came to know that
                people also wanted that the app should have a online payment option</p>

                Competitive Analysis
            </h1>
            <p>We looked for the competive bakery owners but none of them directly competed to Customs bakery.</p>
            <p>In my competive audit I found that not many of the bakery was having it's own dedicated mobile ordering
                app.</p>
            <p>The main differences I noticed between competitors are: </p>
            <li>- Customization for cakes was not an option.</li>
            <li>- There were no sugar free items available in the bakry.</li>
            <li>- Other bakery items like donuts and baugettes were not available.</li>
            <li>- The range of bakery fast food was very less.</li>

        <div id="affinity">
            <p>We then used an affinity diagram to seperate the data into the groups of tasks which were further
                categorized by high level goals for improvement in <span>efficiency, process, depth, and
                    familiarity.</span>Recognizing the conflicts of interest from each user allowed me to focus on
                shaping user goals and how those goals would in-turn also affect the buisness' goals.</p>

        <div id="userFlow">

            <p>We then created a user flow of what a basic start to finish user journey looks like while purchasing an
                item. This helps us in understanding ways user can interact with the product, as well as allowing us to
                see navigation through user goals.</p>

            <p>After sketching out some p&p wireframes and thinking through the preliminary flow, we reviewed what was
                necessary, unecessary, and what areas are needed to improve. We poured a lot of time for this lo-fi as
                to make sure we are good to go for the hi-fi proto.</p>
